This repository contains data and scripts used for the analysis of woody cover change in South African protected areas and its relationship to large herbivores and atmospheric reactive nitrogen deposition. 
The manuscript ("Functionally diverse larger herbivore communities could mitigate effects of woody expansion") will be submitted to Global Change Biology soon.
