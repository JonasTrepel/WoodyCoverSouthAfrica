### **`sub_saharan_african_pas_w_covariates.csv`**
Contains data for filtered PAs across Sub-Saharan Africa (refer to the methods section of the associated paper for details).

### **`ReserveDataSouthAfricaFinal.csv`**
The main dataset in this repository. It includes reserve-level data for South Africa, with various ecological, environmental, and spatial attributes. Data ownership information is provided below.
