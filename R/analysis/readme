"interaction_plots.R": code to run the best models with the full data and create the interaction plots 

"multipleModelsForLoop.R": code to run all models on our main dataset. Can take a couple of days. 

"pseudoParallelML/": This is an emberassing, but the multipleModelsForLoop code breaks when using a for each loop instead (for whatever reason). So this folder contains 4 scripts to run the models for current woody cover (CWC), woody cover change (WCC), woody cover heterogeneity (WCSD) and canopy height heterogeneity (CHSD) in different R sessions "parallel"....

"multipleModelsSouthAfricanPas.R": Code to run the models for the South African PAs

"multipleModelsSubSaharanPas.R": Code to run the models for the Sub-Saharan African PAs

"simulating_tree_cover_after_100y.R": Code to simulate the woody cover after 100y at different scenarios of starting conditions and herbivore impact 

"deprectad/": Contains deprectaed code. Don't go in there, may contain not-working scripts and stupid mistakes.
